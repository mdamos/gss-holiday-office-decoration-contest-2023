And yes. This is THE polar bear from the Coca-cola ad. We are in the presence of a celebrity.


**Fred, the dinosaur, was spotted taking his holiday lambo for a spin around this scenic lighthouse**

For those who were here at the last holiday gathering, you may remember the holiday lambo. Well, it has now made a reappearance with Fred, the Dino, in the driver seat.

**And for those who questioned whether I actually decorated my office for the 2021 GSS holiday party, or if I just copied a high quality photo from Google and used it as my entry (I'm looking at you _ANITHA_ 👀)...here is my face w/ my decorations from this year (2023):**
